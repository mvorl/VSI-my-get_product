**my-get_product** was inspired by [VSI's get_product GitHub project](https://github.com/vmssoftware/get_product) which is

> a small python script created for educational purposes which allows to get the information about new version of open 
source products from https://vmssoftware.com/ and download them.

It was last updated in 2021.

Since then the VSI open source products web pages have been restructured so that get_product does not work any more.
my-get_product adapts the process of getting the version numbers and download links to the new structure.
